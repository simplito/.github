## Simplito develops [PrivMX](https://privmx.cloud/) - an Infrastructure for End-To-End Encrypted (E2EE) Communication.Â 

PrivMX offers developer tools, including libraries and APIs, that enable building or expanding applications with custom encrypted channels. 
These tools facilitate secure transfer and storage of messages, data, and real-time streams.
